# Sitecore Learning Mind map
Sitecore learning mind map is a list of topics which you would like to learn. Sitecore Eco system has grown and even after working on Sitecore for a decade at times I also need to refer few sources to confirm something.

It might get overwhelmed for newbies to know everything about Sitecore. That's why thought to create a single learning mind map. Which can be referred not only by newbies. But also by experienced folks. Who can refer this.
