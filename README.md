# Sitecore Learning Mind map
The Sitecore learning mind map is a list of topics that you would like to learn. Sitecore Ecosystem has grown and even after working on Sitecore for a decade at times I also need to refer few sources to confirm something.

It might get overwhelmed for newbies to know everything about Sitecore. That's why thought to create a single learning mind map. Which can be referred not only by newbies. But also by experienced folks can refer.

Which allows you to zoom, scroll and click on links for a few of the topics. (I would like to add the link for all topics some day!)

This list might not have everything. But that's where I need your help. Please create a request here and I will update the mind map for you!
