The Sitecore learning mind map is a list of topics organized by high-level category.  Which should help newbie/experienced Sitecore enthusiasts to explore sources by category.

Which allows you to zoom, scroll and click on links for a few of the topics. (I would like to add the link for all topics someday!)

This list might not have everything as the Sitecore ecosystem has grown a lot! But feel free to create a request in GitHub and I will update it for you!
